# Ideas

## Tug of war

- Both teams pick a trigram (out of n choices?) and a word for that trigram
  - Reveal picked trigram and then have both teams submit (maybe multiple words?)
  - Points based on length and letter usage
  - The team needs to beat the other teams word
  - What to do when a team uses all their letters?
  - Should something happen if you guess the same word that the other team used?

## Sliding window

- After valid word, use a trigram in that word as the next one

## ~Survivor~

- ~First to use all letters wins~
- ~Everyone acts at the same time on the same trigram~
- ~No lives~
- ~No repeat words amongst players~
- ~Bonus letter on > 10 letter words~
- ~Bonus letter after using so many words over the course of the game?~

## Semi co-op

- Take turns (have a letter cooldown) adding letters to make a word
- All lose if shared hearts
- Winner is the one that uses all their letters
- Hide used letters (maybe have total count?)
