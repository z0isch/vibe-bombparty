# Ideas

## Tug of war

- Both teams pick a trigram (out of n choices?) and a word for that trigram
  - Reveal picked trigram and then have both teams submit (maybe multiple words?)
  - Points based on length and letter usage
  - The team needs to beat the other teams word
  - What to do when a team uses all their letters?
  - Should something happen if you guess the same word that the other team used?

## Sliding window

- After valid word, use a trigram in that word as the next one

## Survivor
- First to use all letters wins
- Everyone acts at the same time on the same trigram
- No lives
- No repeat words amongst players
- Bonus letter on > 10 letter words
- Bonus letter after using so many letters over the course of the game?
